This is the HTML documentation for pocnetconfschemaless, a proof of concept
OpenDaylight application that shows how to read and write the configuration of
a NETCONF device that does not offer YANG models or whose YANG model cannot be
parsed by ODL.

This HTML documentation has been generated with Sphinx. The "source code" of
the documentation can be found in the docs/ directory of the
pocnetconfschemaless repository:
